# SD Image Viewer

Based on [viyiviyi](https://github.com/viyiviyi/stable-diffusion-webui-zoomimage) zoom image extension.<br>
a pure DOM manipulation for image zooming, dragging, and touch gestures on touchscreen devices<br>
for txt2img and img2img image viewer.<br>
<br>
what's different, the image will now always centered, except when its width exceeds the screen's width<br>
in that case the image edges will always snap to the screen's edges during dragging.<br>
<br>
Usage:<br>
Use the mouse wheel to zoom in and out, hold left-click to drag the image, or pinch to zoom on touchscreen devices.<br>
