# SD Image Viewer

Based on [viyiviyi](https://github.com/viyiviyi/stable-diffusion-webui-zoomimage) zoom image extension.<br>
a pure DOM manipulation for image zooming, dragging, and touch gestures on touchscreen devices<br>
for txt2img and img2img image viewer.<br>
<br>
what's different, the image will now always centered<br>
and when its width/height exceeds the container's width/height<br>
the image edges will always snap to the container's edges during dragging.<br>
<br>
Usage:<br>
Use mouse wheel/pinch to zoom in and out, hold left-click/touch to drag the image<br>
<br>
